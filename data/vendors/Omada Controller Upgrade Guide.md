Introduction to Omada SDN Controller Solution 
Omada SDN Controller Solution is designed to provide business-class networking solutions for  
demanding and high-traffic environments, such as campuses, hotels, malls, and offices. Developed from 
Omada Controller that can centrally manage wireless access points, Omada SDN Controller acts as the 
command center of the network and provides a unified approach to configuring enterprise networks 
comprised of routers, switches, and wireless access points. Omada SDN Controller simplifies managing 
large-scale networks and offers easy maintenance, ongoing monitoring, and flexible scalability.
T ailored to different needs and applications, Omada SDN Controller offers diverse deployment solutions: 
Omada Software Controller, Omada Hardware Controller, and Omada Cloud-Based Controller. Newly developed Omada Cloud-Based Controller  controller is deployed on the Omada Cloud server. With a 
paid subscription to Omada Cloud Service, you need not install the software on the host or purchase an 
additional hardware device. Three types of Controller differ in forms, but they serve the same functions 
with management of networks. 
Before Y ou Upgrade
1 Upgrade Paths and Version Considerations
Regardless of which type of Omada Controller you are using, you can upgrade it to different forms of 
Omada SDN Controller.

2
  Omada Controller Upgrade Guide
If you are using a version earlier than Omada Software Controller, Release 3.1.4 (Omada Hardware 
Controller, Release 1.2.0) you need to first upgrade to one of the releases that are listed above and 
then follow the upgrade procedure in this guide.
2 Checking Compatibility Matrix
Omada SDN Controller can configure and manage only the certain devices with supported firmwares. 
View the compatibility matrix below to check if your device is compatible with Omada SDN Controller. 
If the firmware version of your device is lower than the version listed, click the button to download the 
latest firmware and extra the firmware file(.bin), then follow the instructions to upgrade it.

3 Feature Updates
Two levels of functional changes that you should pay attention to when upgrading a controller: features to be configured and adjusted features.
■	 Features to be configured
These features will require manual configuration. In other words, these are features that have a 
direct corresponding solution, but for various reasons cannot be automatically upgraded.
Wireless Control > Access Control Access Control has been updated to ACL in the Network Security 
module in Omada SDN Controller 4.1.5. The new function can be 
applied to specific clients or groups whose traffic passes through the 
gateway, switches and EAPs. 
If you want to restore Access Control configurations, go to Settings 
> Network Security > ACL and configure the EAP ACL rules manually 
after upgrading. 

3
  Omada Controller Upgrade Guide
Wireless Control > Portal Portal has been improved in Omada SDN Controller 4.1.5, which can 
take effect on SSIDs and LAN networks. Only one portal is allowed 
for a single site and supports one authentication type (including No 
Authentication, Simple Password, Hotspot, External RADIUS Server, and External Portal Server). For Hotspot, you can select one or more 
authentication modes from Voucher, Local User, SMS, RADIUS, and 
Facebook.
 If you want to restore Portal configuration, go to Settings > 
Authentication and configure Portal manually after upgrading.
Wireless Control > Free Authentication 
PolicyFree Authentication Policy has been changed to Authentication-Free Policy as a subordinate function of Portal in Omada SDN Controller 
4.1.5, which can allow certain clients to access the internet without Portal authentication.
■	 Adjusted features
These are features that have been adjusted or replaced by new designs.
Wireless Control > Scheduler 
Wireless Control > Scheduler AssociationThe two modules are adjusted to the Profile module in Omada SDN 
Controller 4.1.5, which provides a more flexible and practical approach 
for Time Range customization and association.
Insight > Untrusted Rogue APs 
Insight >Trusted Rogue APsThe two modules are adjusted in Omada SDN Controller 4.1.5. Rogue 
APs Detection can scan all channels to detect all nearby APs by an 
optimized mechanism, but will not sort the rouge APs into Trusted or 
Untrusted in the new release, which simplifies the configuration.
Site Settings > Log Settings For old versions, you need to set both the sender’s and receiver’s 
email address to receive system logs, and set Time Mode to determine 
system logs to be sent at a specific time or time interval.
With Mail Server configured on the Controller module, Omada SDN 
Controller 4.1.5 can send emails for resetting your password, pushing notifications, and delivering the system logs. And the system logs will 
be automatically emailed to the mailbox bound with the administrator 
account at a regular interval.
Controller Settings > User Account The tiered roles of system administrators have been redefined. 
The system administrators of the old controller have three types 
of roles with a descending priority: Administrator (including Root Administrator), Operator, and Observer. Correspondingly, Three 
roles of the new release are Master Administrator, Administrator, and 
Viewer.
